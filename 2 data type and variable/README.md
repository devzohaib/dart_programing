# What Are Variables?
Variables are used for storing information which can then be used by the computer program

# Declaring a Variable in Dart
Let’s look at the syntax of how to declare a variable in Dart

`dataType variableName = Initial value`

# What Are Data Types?
The data type of an item or variable is an attribute that tells us what kind of data that variable can have.

# Dart’s Built-In Data Types
The Dart language has special support for the following types
* Numbers
* Strings
* Booleans
* Lists
* Sets
* Maps

# Values and References
Data types can be broadly divided into two categories:

1. **Reference type**
2. **Value type**

The information provided by a value type is the value itself. For a reference type, the information it provides is a reference to some object, i.e., the memory address of where an object is stored.
